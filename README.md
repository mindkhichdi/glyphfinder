## Contribution

Contribution is very welcome! Feel free to open an issue for bug reports, add new tags to the spreadsheet or even open a PR.

### Suggest new tags

Glyphfinder searches through 34.306 characters, the file containing the full list of characters including all tags is too big for GitHub (more than 200 MB). Google Spreadsheet can handle this huge data set very well. If you want to suggest new tags, feel free to add them here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xdlg_pR3jSlTunmcmgZI70ZAQu7N4yoJFcL4Ssn6uJI/edit#gid=1187968163

### Project setup

Feel free to clone the project and fiddle around with our code. You need Node and Yarn, and ‚Äî that‚Äôs special for this project ‚Äì need to generate the list of characters from a Google Spreadsheet.

```
yarn install
yarn generate
```

#### Opens the development build

To start the development version of the app run the start script. The app will open and you‚Äôll be able to use it right-away. Changes to the code will be hot loaded.

```
yarn start
```

#### Lints and fixes files

If you plan to send a PR with changes, run the lint process to fix code style issues:

```
yarn lint
```

## Builds

Don‚Äôt try to build the app, you won‚Äôt be able to code sign and/or notarize the app without a developer certificate. We‚Äôre running the build process manually and publish new versions on the website: https://www.glyphfinder.com
